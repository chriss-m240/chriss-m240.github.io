      <description>This page is part of the Visual Computing course development, here you will find some of our work through the course.
What you are visualizing is a page made with Hugo and deployed on GitHub-pages, thanks to their teams for making this page possible.
Enjoy.</description>

      <description>Te following task is an example of how to add a D3 chart into the Hugo webpage by writting some JS code into the project. The JS code to this specific visualization can be found in the /static/js/chart.js file, where there are some variables and data declared for D3 to properly work and render.
In the case of the .md files there is only a few lines of HTML, defining the use of D3 via a CDN and referencing the JS script mecioned before.</description>

      <description>The first image is the original colorfull image which we are going to transform into black and white images with the following tehcniques. Arithmetic mean This metod is just the i.e. average, of the three components, in the HSI model called intensity (fig. a). This is simply the projection of a point onto the neutral axis—the vertical height of a point in our tilted cube. The advantage is that, together with Euclidean-distance calculations of hue and chroma, this representation preserves distances and angles from the geometry of the RGB cube.</description>

      <title>Lab 1, task 2. P5 - Convolution masks</title>

      <description>Let&#39;s start understanding a little bit about convolutional masks, also known as kernels. It&#39;s a concept normally used in visual computing because it refers to a matrix where some values are defined to achieve certain effect over images or videos. The most common convolutional mask is the blur kernel used to soften an image and create a foggy or a fade effect, here it is what is know as a box blur kernel, characteristic because it defines that the color for a pixel is the arithmetic mean of its neighboring pixels.</description>

      <description>Image Histograms Image histograms visually summarize the distribution of a continuous numeric variable by measuring the frequency at which certain values appear in the image. The x-axis in the image histogram is a number line that displays the range of image pixel values that has been split into number ranges, or bins. A bar is drawn for each bin, and the width of the bar represents the density number range of the bin; the height of the bar represents the number of pixels that fall into that range.</description>

      <description>At first we tried to run the convolutional masks on a video at software level, unfortunaly there was no possible to execute it because the resources given by the browser to the page were not enough to support the complete processing of the video, returning as and error the following.
With that is notorius that running convolutional mask on a software level is no efficient and it takes several computational resources to compute it.</description>

      <description>The following illusion is called Café Wall, it consists of simple elements as it is some black and white squares displayed inside parallel rows tricking our eyes to see not parallel rows as it actually is but evidencing a few slopped squares especially at the ends or sides of the rows. Here is part of the code used to make this visualization:
function draw() { groutWidth = 139 / 25; background(&#39;#444444*2&#39;); numRows = ceil(1000 / (sqWidth)) + 1; for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; numRows; i = i + 1) { line(0, i * sqWidth, 480, i * sqWidth); drawRow(i); } }    The following illusion is called Café Wall, it consists of simple elements as it is some black and white squares displayed inside parallel rows tricking our eyes to see not parallel rows as it actually is but evidencing a few slopped squares especially at the ends or sides of the rows.</description>
