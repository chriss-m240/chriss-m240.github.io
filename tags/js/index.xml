      <description>Te following task is an example of how to add a D3 chart into the Hugo webpage by writting some JS code into the project. The JS code to this specific visualization can be found in the /static/js/chart.js file, where there are some variables and data declared for D3 to properly work and render.
In the case of the .md files there is only a few lines of HTML, defining the use of D3 via a CDN and referencing the JS script mecioned before.</description>

      <description>Let&#39;s start understanding a little bit about convolutional masks, also known as kernels. It&#39;s a concept normally used in visual computing because it refers to a matrix where some values are defined to achieve certain effect over images or videos. The most common convolutional mask is the blur kernel used to soften an image and create a foggy or a fade effect, here it is what is know as a box blur kernel, characteristic because it defines that the color for a pixel is the arithmetic mean of its neighboring pixels.</description>

      <description>Image Histograms Image histograms visually summarize the distribution of a continuous numeric variable by measuring the frequency at which certain values appear in the image. The x-axis in the image histogram is a number line that displays the range of image pixel values that has been split into number ranges, or bins. A bar is drawn for each bin, and the width of the bar represents the density number range of the bin; the height of the bar represents the number of pixels that fall into that range.</description>
